# Recipe Recommendation Program

This program helps combat food waste by recommending recipes based on an ingredient you need to cook before it goes bad. It's perfect for when you have a perishable ingredient at home and are unsure of what recipes to make with it. Simply choose the desired ingredient, and the program will provide a list of recipes featuring it!

## How It Works

1. **Ingredient Selection**: You input the first letter of the ingredient you have, and the program filters through a list of all available ingredients that start with that letter.
2. **Recipe Suggestions**: After selecting an ingredient, the program suggests recipes that use that ingredient.
3. **Interactive**: You can continue searching for recipes with other ingredients or exit the program whenever you like.

## Features
